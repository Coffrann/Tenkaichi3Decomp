"""import_chara.py - make a character package (docs/port/character_packages.md) from a character of a game data folder.

    port/tools/import_chara.py <data folder> <character id 0..160> <output folder> [--name "Name In The Menu"] [--replace]
    port/tools/import_chara.py <data folder> <id> <folder of folders> --with-forms [--with-fusions] [--prefix P] [--replace]

Without --replace the folder ADDS a character (its character.txt says `base=<id>`). With --replace it REPLACES the
disc's character of that id (`replaces=<id>`): put into `characters/` as it is, the game plays exactly as before,
and every file in it can then be edited or taken out (a file the folder does not have stays the disc's). That is
the start of a mod of an existing character: export, edit, drop back in.

With --with-forms the character's transformations are imported too, and theirs: a folder named as the disc
names the character, its forms in folders inside it named by their labels ("Super Saiyan"), with link lines in
each character.txt that name the others (".." is the character from inside a form's folder): the set works as it does on its
disc. A name the disc does not give is the prefix ("C" unless given) and the id. --with-fusions follows the fusions as well: their results, the
partners, and the forms of all of those (that can be many folders; the port takes 57).

    port/tools/import_chara.py <data folder or .iso> --names

--names prints the disc's characters: the id (what `base=`, `replaces=` and `disc:<id>` take), the name and the
form's label, as the character select has them.

    port/tools/import_chara.py <data folder or .iso> <folder of folders> --all

    port/tools/import_chara.py <data folder or .iso> <folder> --stages [--against <original data folder or .iso>]

--stages copies the disc's stages (the single-screen model, file 0x171 + stage) as `<Name>.unk` files, which is
what the `stages` folder next to the game takes (docs/port/adding_stages.md; 26 at once). The names are the places'
names in the original game: a name on a disc is a picture, so what a changed stage is called there cannot be read;
rename the files; `stage names.png`, written beside them, shows the disc's own names in the stages' order. With --against only the stages that differ from that disc's are copied.

    port/tools/import_chara.py <folder of loose files> <output folder> --loose [--name N] [--base ID] [--data <game>]

--loose makes a character folder from files taken out of a disc one by one, as mods are often passed on: any
extension (.unk, .pak, .bin), the archive's number of the file somewhere in the name ("model(2918).unk"). The
number says what a file is (a costume, the animations, the effects, a voice bank, the portrait) and the contents are
looked at as well. Without --base the base character is the original whose model is most like this one (that needs
--data, the game's data folder or disc image) or else the character whose place the number names.

    port/tools/import_chara.py --to-png <chip.bin | member_1p.bin | portrait.bin> <picture.png>
    port/tools/import_chara.py --from-png <picture.png> <new .bin> --like <a .bin of the same kind>

The pictures of a package to a PNG and back. --to-png writes the picture of one of the three files. --from-png
makes such a file from a PNG: the file named by --like (any chip, member block or portrait, for instance the one
an import wrote) gives the kind and the size, and only its picture is replaced. The sizes are 64 x 64 (chip),
64 x 32 (member block) and 256 x 512 (portrait); a PNG of another size is resized, and one with more than 256
colours is brought down to 256. Transparency is kept. No game data is needed.

<data folder> may also be a disc image (.iso): its two archives are read in place, nothing is unpacked. --all makes
a folder for every character of the disc, forms inside (more than the port takes at once: a shelf to pick from).

<data folder> is an unpacked disc in the layout the port uses (pzs3us1/NNNNN.bin, pzs3us2/NNNNN.bin): the player's
own game, or another disc of the same layout whose characters were replaced. Everything that belongs to the one
character is copied as it is, under the names the port looks for in a folder of `characters/`:

    <n>_1p.pak .. <n>_4p.pak, <n>_1p_dmg.pak ..   the models (file 0x590 + id * 10 + 0..7)
    <n>_anm.pak, <n>_eff.pak                      animations and effects (+ 8, + 9)
    <n>_voice_jp.pak, <n>_voice_us.pak            the voice banks (0xBDA + id Japanese, 0xC7B + id English)
    voice_jp/NNN.adx, voice_us/NNN.adx            the spoken lines (0x8D4E + id * 100 + line, 0xCC32 + ...)
    portrait.bin                                  the large picture of the menus (0x2F9 + id)
    member_1p.bin, member_2p.bin                  the team mate's small picture in the fight (8 + id * 2 + side)
    chip.bin                                      the select's chip (menu archive, file 0x1C1)
    character.txt                                 the manifest: format=1, name, form (the label under the name),
                                                  and base=<id> (the tables of the game the folder is put into
                                                  are asked for this character: health, cost, the lines before a
                                                  fight) or, with --replace, replaces=<id>; the links to the
                                                  other folders of a set (left= up= right= down= fusion1.. partner1..)

(Until 2026-10-13 the two voice names were the other way round, and the texts were in files of their own, name.txt,
form.txt, base.txt, forms.txt, which the game still reads. A folder made then has its two languages exchanged now:
make it again, or exchange the names.)

Nothing is converted. The folder holds game data: it is for the player's own use and is not to be passed on with
the game's own art in it.
